In 2015, at the United Nations, more than 190 world leaders committed to 17 [Sustainable Development Goals](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs) (SDG) to end extreme poverty, fight inequality, injustice, climate change, and other critical issues affecting humanity.

This initiative promotes collaboration between Academia, private sector, civil society, and governments to use open data and build open source software in support of the Sustainable Development Goals.
