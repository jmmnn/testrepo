Project Objective
------------
This project aims to generate tools and methodologies to study the decisions and resolutions taken by youth during Model United Nations conferences held worldwide.

Additionally, the project aims to produce tools for better data collection at Model United Nations conferences. Standardized data collection across conferences globally will provide a more in-depth understanding of youth's political opinions.

The outcome of this project will include:

- Data exploration tools for existing datasets
- Analytical studies (e.g. papers and replicable data analysis workbooks) comparing the decisions made by youth with decisions taken by Governments at the United Nations.
- Software to streamline data collection (e.g. voting, documents, multimedia) at Model United Nations conferences worldwide.
