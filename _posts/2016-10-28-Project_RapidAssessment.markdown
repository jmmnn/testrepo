Project Objective
--------------

This project aims to develop tools for rapid assessment of national documents (e.g. infrastructure development plans, laws,  development project documents) to reveal their alignment with the targets established by the sustainable development goals. [Find the SDG targets on paragraph 59](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld) of the document "Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development".

Project deliverables
------------

This project will result on web applications to accelerate the delivery of country assessments carried out by international agencies for development such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). See the Rapid Integrated Assessment studies which are being carried out in more than 30 countries by UNDP within the next year. Related documents:

However, the desk review of the documentation to prepare an integrated multi-sectoral assessment is lengthy, taking away valuable time for analysis. Ideally, the tools developed through this project will make the national documents easy to search by development topic and to provide a machine-based initial assessment of the alignment with the SDG targets.
