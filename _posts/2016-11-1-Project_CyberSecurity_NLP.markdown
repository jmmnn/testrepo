Project Objective
--------------

This project aims to analyze the National CyberSecurity Strategies of close to one hundred countries in the International Telecommunications Union who have made them publicly-available.

Access them here:  
[National Cyberse​​curity Strategies repository​](http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Cybersecurity/Pages/National-Strategies-repository.aspx)

Project deliverables
------------

This project will result on a web application enabling search and visualization of the CyberSecurity strategies given. The web application will allow the user to view for each strategy the key topics discussed, the keywords used, the main entities (e.g. people, places, organizations, etc.) mentioned, their scope and depth, and any other useful details derived from the text.


1st deliverable - Expected delivery December 15, 2016
-----------------------------------------------------
As a first objective, this project will focus on parsing the cyber security strategies currently available in the repository.

The web application is intended to be showcased at various publicly available websites of the United Nations and other partners.
